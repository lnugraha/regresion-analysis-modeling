## Regression Analysis Modeling Based-On Optimization (R.A.M.B.O) ##

Covers topics in regression analysis, such as linear regression, logistic regression, B-spline, and support vector machine. In general, each regression method will cover two optimization methods: one through machine learning optimzaition method, and one through statistical method

## Data Load and Display ##
- [X] Load Data in 2D or 3D forms
- [X] Display data as a 2D plot
- [ ] Display data as a 2D plot with colors
- [ ] Display data as a 3D surface plot
- [ ] Migrate data to TensorFlow or Torch models

## Linear Regression ##
- [ ] Using statistics approach (R-square value)
- [ ] Using machine learning approach (RMSE value)

## Step-Wise Regression ##

## Logistic Regression ##
- [ ] (Binary or beyond) supervised clasification purpose

## Support Vector Machine ##
- [ ] Binary classification purpose
- [ ] Determine the hyper-plane

## B-Spline ##

## Parametric Regression ##
